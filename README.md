Project Name: Project Echo

Use deep learning (machine learning) to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to identify and classify speakers, from recorded audio.  We will train this network using existing datasets of recorded speakers including meta-data on their sex and dialect/language.  Then, the network should be able to identify these speakers saying things that were not used in the training as well as correctly classifying their gender and dialect.

This project will most likely require an ANN that includes convolutional layers, recurrent connections, or both.  This will allow it to properly analyze the sequential data of spoken audio.

If we can get the network trained and working well, with time remaining in the project window, we would also like to explore using the trained network for things like feature extraction and modification of input audio to give it different characteristics (like a different dialect).
